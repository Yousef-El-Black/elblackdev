          <p className="py-4"># Iâ€™m not your normal developer</p>
          <p className="leading-6">
            A full-stack engineer is a developer who has the knowledge and
            expertise to work on both the front-end and back-end of a web
            application. They are skilled in multiple programming languages,
            frameworks, and tools that are necessary for building complex and
            robust web applications.
            <br />
            <br /> As a full-stack engineer, your main responsibility is to
            ensure that the web application functions smoothly, from the user
            interface to the server-side logic. You must be comfortable working
            with both client-side and server-side technologies, including HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB.
            <br />
            <br /> In addition to technical skills, full-stack engineers also
            need to possess strong problem-solving abilities and a willingness
            to learn new technologies as they emerge. They must be able to work
            collaboratively with designers, product managers, and other
            stakeholders to understand user requirements and deliver
            high-quality software solutions.
